\begin{exercise}{4.6}
    Consider the eigenvalues of the operators, $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$, where $L_1 u = u_x$, $L_2 u = -\alpha u_{xx}$, $\alpha = 1.0 e^{-5}$, and $L_3 = L_1 + L_2$, with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions.
    For which of the operators are the eigenvalues positive and real?
    Repeat the exercise with $L_1 = x u_x$.
