\section*{Exam formalities}
Six problems/topics are given for this exam.
For each problem, the candidate must prepare a 20 minutes oral presentation.
Try to communicate a good overview and understanding of the topic, but compose the talk so that you can demonstrate knowledge about details too.
The student is expected to be able to stick to one subject for the 30 minutes for top grades.
There are no aids besides a whiteboard and this document with the exam problems (experience with this type of exam and various aids tells that learning the content by heart gives by far the best delivery that demonstrates solid understanding).

We will throw a die and the number of eyes determines the topic to be presented.
After your presentation, you will be given some questions, either about parts of your presentation or facts from the other topics.
After each presentation, the next candidate can throw the die and thereby get about 10 minutes to collect the thoughts before presenting the assigned topic.
